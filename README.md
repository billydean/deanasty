# "DEAN"asty, a Dynastic Lineage and History Generator

## Description
Deanasty generates an individual, set in a neutral environment, and then sketches out their legacy and lineage year-by-year with every click. Feedback loops ensure that historical context evolves along with any newly generated family members. In later versions, generated content ought to be available in log format (i.e. as annals of historically significant events), as a timeline, or as a dynastic family tree.

More TBD.

## Running the Project
Deanasty currently only runs locally. After installing dependencies with yarn, "yarn run start" should launch the application.

More TBD.

## Instructions
Because all calculations and generated assets are kept in state, the user should be able to switch freely between the different views indicated on the left-hand side. 

At the top, "Start" will generate the founder of the family (at Year 0). "Next" will progress the simulation/generator by one year. "Restart" will wipe any generated content and revert to the app's initial state.

More TBD.

## Motivation
The main limitation on many random character (etc) generators I'm familiar with is the relatively narrow range of options elements are selected from. 

If a writer or GM is looking to a generator for inspiration, they might also turn to an AI generator (either generating images or text using predictive models). With both kinds of generators, though, there is typically little (if any) connective tissue between aspects or elements of the generated product. 

I want to develop a self-informed generator, where later calculations are influenced by earlier results. For example: A warlike figure is more likely to wage war. Waging war will affect the overall political climate. People born in unstable climates are more likely to die in war. And so on. 

Generated results are still intended to be "jumping off points" for authors and GMs, but I want them to have enough internal cohesion to be believable (and hopefully, useful).

Since I devised this project as an opportunity to practice and grow as a developer, I certainly welcome any suggestions or recommendations on how to improve its performance or build on its design. I'd love your feedback, and if it turns out this tool becomes useful for writers or TTRPG enthusiasts in the future, I'd certainly welcome any contributions.
